# ENGR2900 Project 2 - Hand Pose estimation

This is the codebase to implement hand pose estimation model based on the Ego-Exo4D dataset. Follow instruction below to install the necessary packages. Feel free to reuse the environment from Project 1 if you want, in which case you don't need to create a new environment but only activate the Project 1 environment.

### Environment

Follow instructions below to create a new environment and install all required packages for model training and evaluation.

```
conda create -n engr2900-p2 python=3.8.12 -y
conda activate engr2900-p2
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
